# App Name: 
Hypixel Skyblock Accessory Checker

# Status: 
Still in development

# Problem:
Existing Skyblock tools like Skycrypt and Skyblock Discord Bot don't provide an intuitive way to check which accessories and their upgrades you're still missing.

<b>Skycrypt</b> in particular does not sort missing accessories into family lines. Instead, they are simply clumped together into a dashboard. To make it worse, the accessories' name are NOT displayed on the page without a native search function provided. As a result, you cannot search using Ctrl + F, making it a guessing game to find what accessory you're looking for through its texture pack icon. The texture pack it use is Furfsky, which is not what everyone uses, making this process a nightmare for those who uses a different texture pack.

<b>Skyblock Discord Bot</b> instead provides the most cost effective accessories/upgrades in terms of MP to Lowest BIN. This is more intuitive than Skycrypt. However, it still lacks the option to display all missing accessories/upgrades in one page as well as the option to sort them into family lines.

# Scope:
The app for Desktop I am developing will address these problems. It will:
1) Sort accessories and their upgrades into family lines. For each family line of an accessory, only the next tiers will be shown, whereas the lower tiers won't be shown to avoid confusion.
2) Provide the lowest Bin Value in addition to their MP to Cost ratio.
3) Provide a separate table to show most cost effective accessories/ugprades like Skyblock Discord Bot.
